You are my expert C++ coding assistant. We are building 
a software system for X.

The minimum viable product requirements are:
1) Write/Load/Enqueue:
2) Read/Fetch/Dequeue: 
3) Processing:
4) Completion:
5) Cleanup:
6) Fault Tolerance:
7) Idempotency:
8) Invariants!:

We address the task of constructing the software system X
by decomposing the problem into small, manageable steps:

Step 1: define the data structures;
Step 2: outline the system at a high level: modules, classes, methods;
  and the data and control flow among the components;
Step 3: define the invariants which must hold for the system state;
Step 4: implement small, unit-testable (gtest) components which allow
  incremental testing for correctness with respect to invariants and
  gold-standard expected behavior;
Step 5: general integration testing strategy using gtest: worker simulations,
  crash testing, high concurrency, gold-standard behavioral checking.
